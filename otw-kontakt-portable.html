I thought I’d ask the community for some advice before I impulse buy and make my first purchase. I’d really like to mimic the sounds of some of my favourite artists. I admire the work of Buddy Ross, a pianist for the likes of Frank Ocean. I’ve done some research and I’ve seen he uses Rhodes, Roland and Wurlitzer. I’m looking for that smooth electric piano sound. I’d be nice to have adjustable modulato.

Native Instruments Kontakt 5 v5.7.1 Portable WiN 401 Mb Once again, NATIVE INSTRUMENTS raises the bar with KONTAKT 5 - the latest version of the industry-leading sampler. i've been blowing my brains doing research on what laptop to buy for the past couple of weeks. if you own, or know anybody that owns xyz laptop that uses ableton 10 with a fair number of sound vst (serum/omni/kontakt) and effects and works well, please let me know. full context below- okay so i had a couple main guidelines: 1. as light as it can possibly be while being a quad core i7 or higher (6 core i7 and 6 core i9 is great too if heat is ok) 2. a dedicated not too shitty graphics.

I like that's it's portable, I love the DAW control, but I hate that certain things from the S Series MK1 are missing that I was not expecting (like the big browser window and the speed of scrolling). # The good stuff It feels great. Even though the keys are mini sized, they feel a lot nicer than a lot of similar sized controllers I've tried (such as the Akai LPK25). The buttons are clicky, and the whole unit is very light while still giving the impression of durability.

I'm lucky enough to have full licenses for both Sibelius and Pro Tools, and the entire catalogue of Native Instruments. I'd love to move out of the piano roll environment of Pro Tools and into Sibelius. The trouble is, I want to be working with decent sounds (I'm currently suffering from General MIDI basic sickness!) and have no idea how. I know roughly about manually assigning sounds from Kontakt to Sibelius - but that'd take an eternity and probably not even be entirely functional If you need to contact us regarding our software, this website, or anything else, you've come to the right place.

Hey All, I'm currently in the market for a new laptop. I've gone back an forth on whether I should just get a desktop, but at the end of the day I want the flexibility to be able to be portable. My old laptop died, so I currently use my wife's old HP Elitebook, with an i5-3427u, 8GB of RAM and a small 180GB SSD. It's not performing as well as I'd like. I use FL Studio, and basically I now have to limit my projects quite a bit or freeze tracks to avoid the performance going Kontakt v5.6.6 PORTABLE Год/Дата Выпуска: 21.02.2017 Версия: 5.6 Build 6 Разработчик: Native Instruments Сайт разработчика: native-instruments.com Формат: STANDALONE, VSTi Разрядность: 32bit, 64bit Таблэтка: Вылечено.

Hi all, I'm curious to see how everyone here manages their data storage as it can become quite a problem as sample libraries grow, and more projects accumulate. I know a lot of people like to store their projects on a dedicated external drive, however, I prefer to store my projects internally because I like to produce at home, on the road, at work when its quiet (shh) etc. My samples are also stored internally, as well as my most used Kontakt libraries. However, I have a high speed Native Instruments Kontakt 6 v6.1.0 Portable WiN 404 Mb With KONTAKT 6, you can sound like a snare drum, a symphony orchestra, or anything in between, from a universe of sampled instruments. Hey all, I'm looking for a 88 key weighted keyboard to use for gigs and at home. I'd like it to be as portable as possible so onboard speakers aren't necessarily a priority however if you think that the onboard samples can be as good as the 6GB Kontakt VST that I'm currently using then maybe I should reconsider the extra weight amp size. I've been able to get exactly the sound I'm looking for using external samples. A priority would be the feel of the weighted keys.

I am a musician who works mainly on a desktop, but I need a laptop to use for travel and for teaching. Here is my problem: The applications I use do not work properly with Windows DirectSound driver. They work fine with WASAPI or ASIO4ALL, although the latter can be frustratingly finicky. This works fine just for working; however, I teach at a university, and I frequently need to use my laptop in the classroom and in one-on-. Total budget and country of purchase: Somewhere around 00. I have no hard limit, but I'm a college student and would like to save as much money as possible. Do you prefer a 2 in 1 form factor, good battery life or best specifications for the money? Pick or include any that apply. A touch screen looks very cool, but they tend to gimp the CPU. I'm looking for a quad core with around 3 GHz or more. How important is weight and thinness to you? I need something portable.

I've been considering getting an iPad to use for sequencing my synths (plus perhaps some internal apps), but I'm wondering if I'd be better off getting a similarly-sized / powered Windows Tablet/Laptop like an Asus Transformer or Microsoft Surface and using it solely as an instrument (e.g. no email, games, internet, etc.) I would like to be able to play/record MIDI live into/through the tablet/device to my external.
