Since we are in the last year of another decade of Madonna lets look at her catalog yet again.

Music Well it's a new year and soon we will hopefully be graced with Madonna's new album. Until then let's look back at her catalog and reflect on what we loved and what we didn't. So on that note it's time for another Rank 'em. So below list Madonna's albums from #1 being your favorite to #17 being your least. I have included You Can Dance, Who's That Girl, I'm Breathless and Evita because it's more fun this way. So how does your list look?

It is Best Ever Albums the sites goal is to "achieve a means of establishing the greatest music albums of all time by using legitimate critical sources and calculating a ranking based on the rank and number of times an album has appeared in a 'greatest album' chart and then ranking the albums according to their aggregate performance" I don't know how actually official it is but they have chart So Madonna's birthday is coming up and it's been about a year since we did an album ranking so to celebrate her big 60 lets get down and do it again, and RANK THOSE ALBUMS! This time lets put a little twist on it. We aren't going to rank favorite to least favorite, instead rank down bellow from currently most listened to album to least listened to album of her studio albums (I'm Breathless is included). So let's see what is in the most rotation for everyone and what is in the least. So it's time for another fun ranking. This time bellow nominate any song from Madonna's catalog you think is one of her best (If a song has already been nominated don't nominate it again, nominate another song. It wont matter who made the submission in the end. You can also nominate as many songs as you like) You have one week to nominate as many songs as you'd like before the next stage in the ranking. HAPPY NOMINATING!!!

Another late night. Design, after design, after design. The girl in the welder's apron had been busily planning her new creations for weeks now. She hadn't had the tools before, or the materials. Not starting out. She did now. She'd scavenged what she could, bought what she couldn't. Enough to not need to cobble her shit together from lawn mowers and car batteries. She could get a lot done in a short period of time, her mutation saw to that. She was going to do things right. For whatever reason I still have Fire Island still on. they just showed two big things for next week: Snatch Game and a re-do of the "Night of 1000 Madonnas" runway! ampnbsp; /u/nyu2016 got some screenshots (https://www.reddit.com/r/rupaulsdragrace/comments/66te2b/episode_6_trailer_pics/). so we know: ampnbsp; gt Snatch Game Peppermint as NeNe Leakes (https://i.imgur.com/Y8nLo2p.jpg), Shea as Naomi Campbell (https://i.imgur.com/XayepSH.png) (thanks /u/ImonABea. Wrote this years back-pretty extra but I guess I'll share it with ya'll.

She has won countless awards including Grammies, MTV Music Video Awards, and Golden Globes, being the highest grossing female music artist of time.

Over the past few months I've been compiling a list of Funko POP! figures I would like to see. Many are likely possibilities, while many others have no chance in hell of being made. Based on my list what do you think is missing? Edit: It looks like the formatting is all messed up, I'll try to fix it when I get a chance. On the mobile app it's formatted mostly correct, though! Funko POP! Fantasy Wish List __________ Ad Icons _____ 80’s Series - The California Raisins (2-Pack) - Chester. First, pick one song from each of her thirteen studio albums  Madonna Like A Virgin True Blue Like A Prayer Erotica Bedtime Stories Ray Of Light Music American Life Confessions On A Dance Floor Hard Candy MDNA Rebel Heart Your final collection must contain between 15 and 20 songs featuring Madonna's vocals, so at this point you've got to choose at least two more songs, but you can pick up to seven more. Don't forget about her movie soundtracks (Who's.

If I tried to call it an "eleganza extravaganza" I'd probably be getting a cease and desist letter from Logo (I know some of you got that, lol), so we'll just stick to the plain old extravaganza type.
