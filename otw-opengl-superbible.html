1) Could someone someone do a better job at explaining what attributes and uniforms are. 2) What you are taught from pages 89-100 doesnt help making the sample program, am i supposed to just read and find out of to use GLMatrixStack, GLFrame and other things later? Then why show it now? Sorry if these questions, especially the second one are rather specific. The OpenGL specification describes an abstract API for drawing 2D and 3D graphics. Although it is possible for the API to be implemented entirely in software, it is designed to be implemented mostly or entirely in hardware. The API is defined as a set of functions which may be called by the client program, alongside a set of named integer constants (for example, the constant GL_TEXTURE_2D.

I am a little new to c++ (I am familiar with it, however I do not know a lot of the more modern approaches to things since I come from c) and I decided to start learning opengl aswell. I have purchased the opengl superbible and am currently going trough it, implementing each "lesson" in a nice modular class. Currently I am stuck on the shader class. I am making it a little more complicated with a custom filetype where you can specify all shaders and the program will find the newest/supp. OpenGL (Open Graphics Library) — спецификация, определяющая платформонезависимый (независимый от языка  OpenGL.

Are there any good modern opengl textbooks that anyone recommends? I've heard about the red book and the superbible but it seems that a lot of people don't recommend it or they mention it doesn't actually teach modern opengl and uses it's own teaching library. I'd like to avoid that if possible. I've seen the tutorials in the sidebar but I'd prefer a book if possible, that way I could have something that sort of outlines what I need to learn and goes over the material.

Hi All, I know you've all answered this question many times, but it hasn't been asked here in about 6 months and since things change all the time I'd like to ask again: what's the best way for an experienced C++ programmer, with little to no 3D graphics programming experience, to learn OpenGL - with the intent of eventually developing a small 2.5D or 3D engine? I collected the most promising resources from the side bar, opengl.org, and previous questions: Books OpenGL Programming Guide.

Everyday low prices and free delivery on eligible orders. During my university Days (4 years ago) I bought the Open GL Super bible expecting to dive into it whilst doing my Game Programming Module (which involved the use of OpenGL). It turned out that the module seriously lacked in content and the GL framework we used was never explained, we simply built cubes from arrays of vertices and never got into fragment or even vertex shader theory or implementation. Overall I was disappointed and haven't spent the time to look at the book since. Всем привет. Вопрос к тем кто пробовал собрать исходники.

Now I've heard that OpenGL is the way to go so I looked it up, and I found the superbible to be the best way to learn it but when I went to the comments, there were people talking about different languages all over the place, how can one library support all these different languages, isn't a library supposed to have methods that can be implemented and used for your needs? I mean how can one universal library have methods

People have adviced the blue super bible but I do not not know if it focuses only on OpenGL 4 and tools such as Glew.

Martin Ecker writes "The OpenGL SuperBible, in its vastly expanded fourth edition, is the latest addition to the Addison-Wesley Professional OpenGL series. According to the authors it 'strives to provide the world's best introduction to not only OpenGL, but 3D graphics programming in general.'. 
I'm a 2nd year comp sci student, and I'm studying OpenGL for Games Programming. First of all, what is OpenGL? Because at first I thought it was it's own language, and then turns out we're using C. Then I look at these tutorials ( and it has every code in OpenGL for every language apart from C, but it all looks pretty much the same. How does that work exactly?
