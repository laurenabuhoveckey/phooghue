                            <p>Been playing the draft lately because I have no team amp it made me realise how much I enjoy playing without the pressure of rewards or certain finishes. I know single matches are there, but they’re such a mixed bag. I’d love seasons amp knockout tournies to run alongside FUT champs so we have much more choice in the game. Idk about anyone else but I’ve noticed a significant drop in my friends who play UT amp it directly coincides with an introduction of more and more competitive Aside from the beckham face scan which i don't care about, the only ''extra'' i'd get are Receive 3 player contract renewals each week for a total of 20/30 weeks. Receive 3 guaranteed players rated over 75+ each week for 20/30 weeks. Standard costs 9 eur while beckham 14 and legend 18. Are these worth it at this point? I'm asking cause it would be my first time playing PES since 2006 and i've got no idea if i can still play online since it's been 6 months (if you buy fifa now, u don't. Last week I created a survey to gauge opinions and to see where people are with this years Fifa. The response I got was honestly fantastic, over 10000 people answered the survey! So without further ado, lets get into the results. What Division are you in? Division 5 - 49.8% of people Division 4 - 26.2% of people Division 6 - 11.8% of people Division 3 - 8% of people Division 2 - 1.3% of people Division 1 - 1% of people Division 7/Division 10 - 0.9% of people Division. As promised, here is the complete analysis as well as a compilation of insights that I got from OPs thread. Thanks a lot, Tape Ten for the data. We need to bring this out so everyone knows the reality of this game's packs. Key Insights 1. After spending 23 Million Coins or 453k Fifa Points, the coins that OP got back after selling every item he packed is just 14 Million Coins. Is this fair EA? 2. Average ROI ratio is 0.38 ( Median since average doesn't make sense in this case due to outliers. (This is my opinion. I hope you respect it, even if you disagree!) Hey all. First time posting here but long time FUT player, going back to UT in Fifa 14 and normal FIFA player since FIFA 03! I love this game, despite its many flaws, which I will not be discussing here. I’m sure there are many posts on this subreddit dedicated to the clunky AI, lag, events in-game that feel ‘scripted’ and lots more! Now without doubt this topic must’ve been brought up before but I would like to discuss Hello! I started looking back at FIFA 14 and the type of content I was producing through the WC Mode, and while I definitely did engage with it a lot, I was also still producing "regular" FUT content, and after the first few weeks most definitely more regular content than WC Content. I know a lot of people (myself included) are hoping the escape of the WC Mode will be a breath of fresh air until FUT 19, but remember that there will still be plenty to do in FUT mode, and even with the inclusi. 
amp#x200B; TLDR DEAR EA , amp#x200B; After talking to the support for nearly 10 times every week since fifa 19 launch, i've come to the understanding that they don't have the feature of putting you in the weekend league. And since last season they've lost the privilages of handing out draft tokens as well. Please, Think about it draft of 15,000 coins is roughly 30 games for some(honest kind) , for some it's lying around money spent on fifa, Right ? i ain't quoting youtubers I had originally posted this on serious FIFA and x-posted it here, but it got removed. However I'm interested in the discussion with r/FIFA too, so here you go! First I'll open with the fact that I realise we're only 3 days into the promo, and there is plenty of time to go for EA to release more things. With that being said, I'll give my thoughts on the promo, what's right, what's wrong, and what could have been. This isn't intended as "shots" at EA, and wont be constructed in such a manner. So since FIFA 14, I’ve been buying FIFA every year, some being better then the other but I’ve always managed to enjoy them bc UT. But I’m really considering skipping a year bc of my experience with 18. When the demo came out, I was hooked immediately, and thought that 18 was going to be the best fifa since 14. The day it came out, me and a friend just spent an entire afternoon playing games bc we just couldn’t stop playing, something I only had with 14 so far. But boy, I was wrong. The patch. So since FIFA 14, I have been a regular player of the game. Each game has had their flaw obviously. FIFA 14, heading and crossing was far too overpowered. FIFA 15, pace was everything. Every FIFA has an issue, but I will genuinely say I had a blast with FIFA 14 and FIFA 15. FIFA 16 was fun, but it was nothing special. Then FIFA 17 comes along, and FUT Draft had come. This mode was great, but I found myself never feeling satisfied or happy by the time I was done, more exhausted and frustrated. I've been playing FIFA since '98 stopped only between 10 and 12 and have been playing Ultimate Team since 12, in 12 all we had were shitty seasons giving us 10k and a kit for 8 wins in division 1 (where all the tryhards used to play back then) so average players like me never succeeded and stayed in Div 2 and Div 3 for most of the time, we had online tournaments aswell kind of the DKT we have right now but shittier, saying that you couldn't buy the major players like Ronaldo or Messi unless. 
I remember around FIFA 13 when people like KSI used to complain at EA for not adding anything new to the game. No innovation, just the same thing every year. At least back then the gameplay was fun. Since FIFA 14 they've done a pretty good job at innovating and adding new things to the game. Here's a list of what they've added in each iteration: FIFA 14 : Legends on Xbox, FUT World Cup Mode FIFA 15 : Futties FIFA 16 : FUT Draft, Women (anyone use this?) FIFA 17 : FUT Champions First I'll open with the fact that I realise we're only 3 days into the promo, and there is plenty of time to go for EA to release more things. With that being said, I'll give my thoughts on the promo, what's right, what's wrong, and what could have been. This isn't intended as "shots" at EA, and wont be constructed in such a manner that I'm abusing them at all, simply my musings. According to EA on their website, FUT Birthday has the following; (https://www.easports.com/fifa/ultimate-team/fut. I've never played more than 10 games in a WL because I just never felt like it or didn't have the time to play, only ever bothered to qualify maybe 4 times since FIFA 17 to now. Mainly just play seasons/draft at my leisure. Despite being able to handle myself as a high division player, I always thought it's just a bit too sweaty, too many games and not fun. I now feel I was right all along. I had Friday amp today free this weekend so I qualified Thursday night at like 1am(to the annoyance. Hey Reddit! I've come up with a few ideas and thoughts on how FIFA can be improved. From what I've gathered from this community, there's been a lot of outcry of wanting this game to be fun, enjoyable and good \(something I think the game isn't\). A lot of people want good replay\-ability value and incentive to play the game. In this thread, I hope that I've came across to solve these issues. Some of my thoughts are based on what I've read and heard from several members of the community. Others. - Fifa 2005, I invited a friend to stay over to study for our final Chemistry exam on the next day. We literally studied 30 minutes when we decided to play a quick FIFA match to vent off. We ended playing ten straight, every match was a dog fight. We studied like 1 hour after that and we played fifa till sunrise, we barely studied at all and we went to the exam with no sleep, somehow we both passed the exam! - Fifa 2007 My then gf, (now my wife) saw how I liked Fifa so much she bought I would love EA to implement a Champions League mode in FUT 19. Imagine the world Cup mode from fifa 14, group stage and knockout and have it like the draft where its all year round. Think it has some replay ability and if they do it right could be amazing. Also maybe if you finish 3rd in group you go to Europa League knockouts, playing for more water downed prizes compared to CL mode but would come up against easier opponents. Just a thought. Let's jump straight in with the basics, when a special card enters the market it remains available in packs for a set period, usually a week. During this period it replaces any/all other versions of this card, and is the only version available in packs. This obviously makes these cards a lot rarer than the basic counterparts and hence sell for a premium. The way their prices fluctuate during the cycle is extremely interesting and differs for each card, but that's for another post. 
I tried to play Online Season today on FUT and I get redirected to buy playstation plus. I have never bought PS Plus ever, never spent any money playing FIFA or on PS ever before in the 10 years of playing FIFA. This seems to be happening with all online features. It's the same with Online Draft and FUT champions (I've played Online Draft before several times in FIFA 17 and 18, never had an issue) I have been playing FUT since FIFA 17 (and FIFA since FIFA 06, didn't play a few years between. I predicted it the moment EA announced that TOTW will a 23-man squad instead of 18, and i remember a post and video on Futhead that explained the amount of potential IFs for this year. Now when you add MOTMs, TOTY, Heros, Record Breakers, TOTS, plus other special cards, those are a lot of new 'special' cards that entice people into emptying their wallets (or their dad's) on FIFA Points. The tournament variety on FUT as not always been fantastic, but this year, it has hit bottom low, utterly. YES! The Web App Is Finally Here! ( We've seen A LOT of posts regarding the web app and EA's early access to the game in the last couple of hours so we decided to create a small post with some FAQ's you guys might find useful. If you have more questions, please use this post to address them and we will add them to the post as we see them useful. 1- How can I access the Web App? This is the official link for the FUT WebApp: https://www.eas. This is my first year playing 2k. i got the free 2k16 from the PS plus promotion and me and my mates fell in love with it. i was a religious fifa player and never considered 2k, despite my love of putting on an NBA game during class when i was bored. this year, while i own 2k17 and fifa 17 i play 2k about 80% of the time. Recently i was talking to one of my friends on skype and he said that the 2k16 free game worked, it got us all hooked on it and stopped us playing Fifa, we discussed EA have essentially taken out the best gamemode there is- leaving behind only seasons (which are defunct) and draft, as Nepenthez pointed out. However, as FIFA 18 is hyped by EA, why don't they add tournaments and SBCs which add to the "welcome back packs". I believe that this would be a good idea as, on top of the packs for being loyal through the regularity of your playing of FUT, this shows loyalty for sticking around towards the end.
