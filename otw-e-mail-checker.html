The more details the better. Parents checking emails, my dad doesn't play computer games anymore so I left out a graphics card. What is your budget (ballpark is okay)? Didn't ask, but if I was told if I can do it cheaper than a pre-built they are interested. In what country are you purchasing your parts? Canada Post a draft of your potential build here (specific parts please). Consider formatting your parts. if i had a list of usernames and passwords. how hard would this be to do? and how slow/fast would it be? the accounts would be aol/hotmail/yahoo/gmail. the list format would be username:pw or username-pw.

Chomp Chomp. amp#x200B; Incredibly grateful, and somewhat shocked by the amount of money they sent my way.

What's up? Recently I've been seeing a lot of collapsed comments in threads I'm opening for the first time. Is this an RES thing? They aren't controversial or low karma comments, so I can't really figure out a pattern. Where does it happen? Random threads Screenshots or mock-ups An example (https://i.imgur.com/7hk7TqY.png) What browser extensions are installed? Ads Link Skipper Augmented Steam Epiverse Floating for YouTube™ Extension Google Docs Offline Google Hangouts Google. Currently after we do a legacy deployment we have to manually do a smoke test and I want to automate this. amp#x200B; Now I have already got specific selenium scripts which do some searches but not a full smoke test. I'm not sure which of the following would be a better way to do it so that others can use the scripts or if it's even possible. amp#x200B; 1) Would I be able to create a Django site with links to multi tests on multiple environments and then selenium take over the current. Almost time to vote! But before we do, you might want to check that your entry is in: Checking I've cleaned the entries and written a fairly rudimentary checker that you can use here ( to see if your entry is in. The check page works for me. but since I only have my own username and computer to test it against, that doesn't really guarantee that it'll work for everyone. If it breaks. Please _comment this thread_, don't All my applications are submitted and complete as of February 3. I know it will be a few weeks until I hear from any schools, but I guess I'm wondering what I should be looking out for. Did you find out you were accepted/rejected via status checker, email, or letter 
We plan, we post, we strut. How did you find out when you got accepted to wherever? I guess I should include phone call in the question. The PySimpleGUI package has been getting a bit more attention since the Qt port was started. There have been a number of misconceptions on how it works under the hood and what it's capable of doing. So, I wrote up this little explanation for the Reddit community. On a basic level, it's capable of producing at least 80% of the typical GUI problems that you would normally use Qt or tkinter to code. The other 20% are the larger commercial-type applications that are not appropriate. So the only extension I have is Google Mail Checker, and I've never had this issue ever, but perhaps for the past week-2 weeks I've been getting a ding notification I couldn't pinpoint till a few days ago. Apparently everytime I get an email chrome decided to notify me but the sound is more annoying then anything and I can't figure out how to make it stop. amp#x200B; The extension has no sound options and I've never had this issue before so I'm unsure if this is some new issue with it, somet. Okay, so I use Firefox because I hate Google as a company because of many things I don't agree with how they run their things. This was all good ever since I was using it but now when I use it on my laptop I notice that battery drain of Firefox is quite aggressive. Is this something that is well known? I was googling this after I saw 89% battery drain from Firefox and it seems like every site shows that Edge is the winner when it comes to battery life but when it comes to Firefox vs Chrome. 
# EDIT Resolved ##Solution gt This is a bug with Chrome 71 which is fixed in chrome 72 (currently in beta). It'll fix itself soon, but in the meantime you can disable Never Ending Reddit from the res settings. (https://www.reddit.com/r/RESissues/comments/aa7da4/difficulties_modding_with_res_after_second_page/ecqech5/) - /u/andytuba From ChromeStatus (https://www.chromestatus.com/features/schedule) gt A stable version of Chrome 72 will be released on January 29 2019. --- What's. What's up? While using never ending scrolling, I am noticing duplicate posts across scrolled pages. Where does it happen? I am seeing this behavior on the Home feed but haven't checked subreddits yet to see if it behaves there as well. Screenshots or mock-ups https://imgur.com/a/nsRKt6E Notice the "White Day Collection" at the top is duplicated on the next page towards the bottom. What browser extensions are installed? Adobe Acrobat, Allow Right-Click, Cisco Webex Extension, Colorzill. Basically after Quantum update all my mail checker addons stopped working, well, their new versions at least. Old addon versions still work fine in Palemoon for example. Not one of them sees any logged in Gmail accounts anymore. Does anyone know any way of fixing this? I tried adding "mail.google.com" as exception for blocking cookies, and then tried disabling blocking of any cookies - this did nothing, addons still don't. </p>
