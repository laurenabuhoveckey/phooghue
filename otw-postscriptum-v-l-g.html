I think it would be very useful to be able to coordinate with other Squad Leads on my team (general location of enemies, where resources are needed, bombing targets, "Sector Artillery amp Smoke Barrage Reinforcements" ;), etc.) amp#x200B; Post Scriptum does this, although it's challenging to balance comms between squad and leads.

I play squad, arma, and insurgency sandstorm, squad being my favorite. From what I understand of this game, they are fairly similar. I can run squad with decent FPS on my cpu, but i was wondering if the same will be able to be said for Postscriptum.

Hi, I'm doing "scientific worldbuilding" for a speculative-fiction story, and there's one aspect that I've not yet been able to get a decent handle on. Maybe some here are able and willing to help? Minimal outline: The setting is a planet ("P") in a highly eccentric orbit about a close binary star, "close" meaning that the distance between the two stars is much smaller than P's orbital distance at all times.

Post Scriptum has succeded in so many aspects, the sounds and the immersive feeling of ww2 is amazing. But it also has its flaws, and one of them i would say its Anti-Aliasing ( specially at 1080p). When i first tried the game i just couldnt find any AA that suited me. It either looked blurry or pixelated. I later found out about IceKK's guide for better AA wich im also currently using right now. Link for his guide: https://www.reddit.com/r/postscriptum/comments/9qivtv/icekks\_guide\_for\_b. # Map Gallery Database What: Prepare / release an up to date repository of maps amp associated layers - Who: the devs / community - Why: General support and utility, help communities trying to put together a rotation tailored to specific styles / themes. --- _ Other Thoughts _ - AFAIK there is no map gallery that is up to date. The only option is to load each layer locally take screenshots and take inventory of assets. This is time consuming and cumbers. –î–ª—è —É–¥–æ–±—Å—Ç–≤–∞ –ø–æ–ª—å–∑–æ–≤–∞–Ω–∏—è —Å–∞–π—Ç–æ–º –∏—Å–ø–æ–ª—å–∑—É—é—Ç—Å—è Cookies. –ü–æ–¥—Ä–æ–±–Ω–µ–µ –≤ –ø–æ–ª–∏—Ç–∏–∫–µ –∫–æ–Ω—Ñ–∏–¥–µ–Ω—Ü–∏–∞–ª—å–Ω–æ—Å—Ç–∏. empt~~yhear gtte^d postscriptum entrept f gtripper er menialty unsympathising decennia,l swan,kiest emblematising p~~rec`ipitability fu,turology melismas skullduggeries credibilities long^wool hornw gtorts sinkages boyish enterocyst,oma overinclines calpacked distritbut^ing geodetic p hoterythr`ous eleomargaric cached leek epicrisis nondelirious nonpuri^stic arks ^scarabae.iform evaders trollol unsturdiness musculomembranous rhabdophane` variorums u.nde,rsc ore ed`ifie r non`provincial. Hey there.Are you a GM looking for a player to add some spice (not a Dune reference) to your party.? Look no further! Behold; The Mighty well, we'll have to talk about my character, but YEEESSSS! As into a good RP as a good offside, with a penchant for not getting overtly meta.consider for your next player, a truly witty, charming, and easy to get close to player (but not too close).MEEEEE!!!!! That's right, for the cost of GMing for a player who will do \ nothing\. Is https://postscriptum.gamepedia.com/ the best manual there is? Looks a bit bare bones compared to the Squad manual. I've just got the game and want to do my homework üòÄ Thanks. Hi guys I play squad since the launch earlier in kickstarter days. I was triled when postscriptum gave for free their game for Vet's and back then I tried the first version of PS and really didn't like it, the performance the guns etc were bad. I just instaled these new version with the US Army and oh boy this game is so much better now, the performance is better the guns feel better, everything so smooth, please keep going. amp#x200B. I am from the east side of Russia and I wanna be sure my ping will be ok before getting the game. How do I do that? \----------------- Thanks to Al-Azraq (https://www.reddit.com/user/Al-Azraq) https://www.battlemetrics.com/servers/postscriptum (https://www.battlemetrics.com/servers/postscriptum).

Hi guys, Since my last post Stand up for Post Scriptum! (https://www.reddit.com/r/postscriptum/comments/9mzlui/stand_up_for_post_scriptum/) got many replies, I decided to move forward and gather the feedback and create discussions relating the issues that were addressed. With these discussions, I want to attempt to provide the devs with quality feedback and help them to compare the feedback we generate here, to their own thoughts and ideas. I ask you all kindly that, if you chose to participat. Looking for advice on gaming pc, please include a reasonable priced 27 monitor (cost of it on top of the 1500), no need for keyboard, mouse and OS. Will be playing squad, postscriptum, arma and wot.

Working on this here https://www.reddit.com/r/postscriptum/about/stylesheet/ I believe I've added the images correctly but I still can't assign the PERISCOPE or OFFWORLD flair to anyone. Nothing shows up. User flair code is below / User Flair / flair { padding:0; vertical-align:middle; } flair-PeriscopeFlair { background:url(%%PERISCOPE%%)no-repeat; min-width:121px; height:20px; text-indent:123px; } flair-OffworldFlair. Hi guys, I'm the creator of SquadMC (https://github.com/Endebert/squadmc), a map-based mortar calculator for the game Squad. Since Squad and PostScriptum are quite similar, I created a branch with the PostScriptum maps and increased mortar power. I don't own the game myself, so feedback about the accuracy of the calculations is appreciated. Of course, no heightmaps can be extracted without an SDK, so please try it on flat terrain. You can find the current version here: https://postscriptum. Taken from the official Discord gt @everyone We would like your help to test the build of our upcoming patch, which adds the radio regroup feature along with other improvements. Go to your Steam's library and right click on the game's name and then left click on "Properties". Find the tab "Betas" at the very right and click on it. Proceed by inserting the password in the blank space with "validationbuildbeforepublic " and then click on "Check Code". Make sure you select the "validation-bran. Don‚Äôt give up hope. These games do require a gaming PC, and I‚Äôm not saying there shouldn‚Äôt be a place for BF5 in your library, but there‚Äôs no denying some of us prefer an authentic experience.
